# Phase 3 Completion Checklist

## Sensor Inputs
- [ ] Wheel odometry publishing at ≥30 Hz
- [ ] IMU data publishing at ≥50 Hz
- [ ] Both sensors have valid covariance matrices
- [ ] Timestamps are synchronized

## EKF Configuration
- [ ] EKF node starts without errors
- [ ] Correct input topics configured
- [ ] 2D mode enabled for ground robot
- [ ] TF publishing enabled

## EKF Output
- [ ] Filtered odometry publishing at ≥30 Hz
- [ ] Position values are valid (no NaN)
- [ ] Orientation is valid quaternion
- [ ] Covariance is positive definite
- [ ] Frame IDs correct (odom → base_link)

## TF Publishing
- [ ] EKF publishes odom → base_link transform
- [ ] Transform updates with robot motion
- [ ] No TF conflicts with other nodes

## Sensor Fusion
- [ ] IMU yaw rate being used
- [ ] IMU acceleration being used (if configured)
- [ ] Filtered output differs from raw wheel odometry
- [ ] Fusion improves rotation accuracy

## Motion Tests
- [ ] Position updates correctly during forward motion
- [ ] Position updates correctly during backward motion
- [ ] Rotation tracked accurately
- [ ] Combined motion (arc) works correctly

## Accuracy Tests
- [ ] 1m forward:  error < 10cm
- [ ] 360° rotation: error < 10°
- [ ] Square pattern return: error < 15cm
- [ ] Stationary drift: < 5cm/min

## Diagnostics
- [ ] EKF diagnostics show healthy status
- [ ] No warning messages in logs
- [ ] Covariance stays bounded

## Integration
- [ ] Works with teleop control
- [ ] Works during continuous operation (10+ min)
- [ ] Recovers from sensor dropouts
